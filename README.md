The Knownly Community website.

This respository contains the source code behind the Knonwly Community at http://www.knownly.net/community

The source is made available to everybody for several reasons:
 - The ambition is to make the Knownly Community as open and inclusive as possible.
 - The hope is that the site will be built through collaboration between our community of artists, creatives, copywriters, designers, developers, growth hackers and marketeers.
 - The community site offers great demonstrations of what's possible with a Knownly website.
 - The site is also great testing ground for sharing advanced Knownly features with they community as they're being worked on.
 
## How the site is built
The Knownly Community website is pure HTML/CSS/Javascript.

It's built using software called Cactus which is really easy to install and setup on Windows, Linux and OS X. We really love it.

## Getting involved
There are any number of ways to get involved. Most important, just make your ideas known.

The most common are:
 - Join in the discussion and make suggestions directly on the Knownly Community website.
 - Install and try out running your own copy of the site. Make changes and submit them for inclusion via pull requests.
